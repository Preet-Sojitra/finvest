# Team AlphaCodes

**Problem Statement**: “Limited access to funding” and “inadequate support system” are the biggest challenges faced by women-owned businesses, according to Forbes. Build a platform that allows female business owners to publicize their businesses and include their story/inspiration behind how it started. By assigning a predefined category to which the business belongs, users can filter the list of categories according to their requirements.

**Our Approach**: We are creating a platform for women entrepreneurs to list their startup to get the recognition and funding they deserve!
People here can invest in startups, list their own startup and get to know the latest news and insights of a startup.

**Required Tech Stack**: Django (Python Web Framework) and some REST APIs
